# DeepFake Detection - Simplified!
DeepFake Detection Web-App[Mirage Breaker] ðŸ–¥ using Deep Learning(ResNext and LSTM), Flask and ReactJs where you can predict whether a video is FAKE Or REAL along with the confidence ratio. 

## Explanation of the Project
- We've created a DeepFake Detection system that intends to detect DeepFake videos using Deep Learning techniques like ResNext and LSTM. Also integrated the trained model with the Frontend UI which uses ReactJs and Backend uses Flask.

1. Deep - This is the root folder.

2. Requirements.txt - Python libraries needed for this project. 

3. To use this application a folder named as 'model' needs to be created and inside this folder, you have to add trained model uploaded at [Trained-Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hH5HJcoTJgmlnByqfw3j2ojhL8MemPJr/view?usp=sharing)

4. To use this application a folders named as 'Uploaded_Files' to be created inside root(Deep) folder.
   
5. To run this application install all necessary libraries

## To run this project clone the repository and execute the following command:
```

pip install -r requirements.txt

cd Deep

python server.py

```
